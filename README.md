# PlotHg
This is a simple plotting tool for visualizing a simulation of a 
Hypergraph. Plotting is done in matplotlib using blitting.

## To Use
You'll need to install [ConstraintHg](https://constrainthg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
to use the package.

You can set visual settings by customizing the `PlotSettings` class.

The master calling function is `plot_simulation()`, to which you pass the
`Hypergraph`, `PlotSettings`, and simulation parameters.

You can follow the demo for more information.

## Notes
This package is released under the MIT license, meaning there's little 
you can't do with it. See the license for full details. This is mostly
a utility package, so regular updates are not expected.
